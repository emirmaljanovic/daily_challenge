/**
 * Challenge
 * 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function PentagonalNumber(num) read num which will be a positive integer and determine how many dots exist in a pentagonal 
 * shape around a center dot on the Nth iteration. For example, in the image below you can see that on the first iteration there is only a single dot, on the second iteration 
 * there are 6 dots, on the third there are 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots. 
 * 
 * Your program should return the number of dots that exist in the whole pentagon on the Nth iteration.
